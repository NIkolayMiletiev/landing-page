        <h2>Auto Token Generator</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the peoples are wanted to create their own token for fun, to
          learn, or for a business that they’re creating but they don’t know how
          to start. The challenge with coding in the Ethereum blockchain network
          is that there aren’t a ton of resources out there for how to do
          things. Here I can explain in simple steps how to create your own
          token on the Ethereum platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decide what you want your token to be : The Token’s Name, The Token’s
          Symbol, The Token’s Decimal Places and The Number of Tokens in
          Circulation.
